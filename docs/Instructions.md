# Getting the Arduino Sketch

Firstly, you will need to have the Arduino IDE installed on your computer. There are many sites which can guide you to getting ready to compile the code for yourself, so I won't try to "re-invent the wheel".

In summary, you will need to set the IDE up to support the processor you intend to use.
For Arduino UNOs and its variants, all you need is to download and install the IDE from http://arduino.cc. As of this writing you have the choice of either the older, "tried-and-tested" Version 1.8.19, or the  * New * Version 2.0. Both versions are suitable, so it's a matter of personal choice which one to use:-) Once installed, all that is required is that you select the board you intend to use - no additional libraries are required.

IF using an ESP32 or ESP8266, there are some additional steps you need to take to prepare to compile for them.

# Downloading the Sketch

Github offers two ways for you to get the code. Either click on the "Code" button and download the "Zip" file. This is by far the simplest and most straight forward method, so download the zipped file and extract to your preferred location
